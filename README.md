# Calculator-Winforms
A basic calculator I made using Winforms and C#. I wanted to see how fast I could make a calculator app using .NET/C#.
The basic functionality was done in half in hour, and the keyboard functionality and refactor was done in roughly an hour altogether.

Please note that this was made using .NET Framework 5.0, which is no longer supported by Microsoft.
